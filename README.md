# About

Lolli.js is an extremely lightweight, easily extensible and unopinionated [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/Eris/) client framework handling commands and events intelligently. Lolli.js was made with the idea of having new bot developers experience an extremely easy entry into the wonderful world of developing bots with Eris while doing all the dirty and seemingly complex work in the background. Lolli.js is easily set up and features a rich, unopinionated and robust command and event handling framework. A new bot powered by Lolli.js can be up and running in less than 5 minutes! This makes Lolli.js the perfect core for simple custom bots and highly demanding, large bots while still being extremely performant, predictable and robust!
